<h1>How does the number of electoral collage votes that a winning presidential candidate gets
    and the number of executive orders that they make relate to each other? 
  We went and researched on tuvalabs.com to find out the relation between electoral votes and executive actions<h1>
 <h2> We found that over the last 45 years a number of electoral votes are going down and so is 
     A number of executive orders being made by the presidents</h2>
   <h2> Ronald Regans got over 525 Electoral Votes in 1984 but just 20 years later 16 years later George W. Bush only got 271.</h2>
   <p>The results show that a number of Executive Actions do change with a number of Electoral Votes.
     The trend is going down for both but the presidents with the most 
     Electoral Votes heading into office are making more Executive actions.
     A possible reason for this is that the more electoral votes that a president gets make him feel more 
     confident about the chance he has to get re-elected for second term. It also can be related to the Senate and House majority 
     but we did not research this. The less cooperative the House and Senate are, the more executive orders need to be passed.</p>
<p>Presidents are getting less electoral votes as the time goes on, it used to be that the winning candidate 
  would win by a small landslide and the losing canidate would lose decisivly, now it has changed where the winner of the election may win by just 1 electoral vote.
  This has lead to a steep drop in the amount of executive actions made by presidents. During the 
  FDR administration 3,728 were signed but just less than 1/10 of that number are being signed by recent presidents.</p>

<h1> Conclution</h1>
    <p>The elections are becoming more partisan and the presidents are in fear that 
      they won't be back for a second term if they make a lot of 
       controversial executive actions.</p>
